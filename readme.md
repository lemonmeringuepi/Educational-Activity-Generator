## Introduction

This program uses the Date object and Math.random to print the following to the console:

* The current date
* The day of the week
* The letter of the day
* The animal of the day
* The number of the day
* A random activity

At the time of creation, I have a two-and-a-half-year-old, so activities will be geared towards that age range.

## Technologies

* JavaScript
* Node.js

## Launch

This program runs in the terminal using node.js. To install node.js, go to [their website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and follow the instructions for your operating system.

### Windows Users

Terminal is not native to Windows. I recommend using [Git Bash For Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) to enable Terminal on your operating system.

### Everybody

Within Terminal, navigate to the directory you saved main.js in. Then, just use node.js to execute the file.

```bash
node main.js your-name
```

Read the messages with your child, make noises together, and have fun doing the included activity. If you aren't too keen on a specific activity, they are randomly generated from a list-- just rerun the program and it will suggest another one.

### Output

![output image](./sample_output.png)

The output shall display "HELLO, FRIEND!" if any name is not specified.

This project is the first [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com) portfolio project for the Back End Engineer career path.

The random activities used in this program are from the Maryland Day by Day family literacy activity calendar, distributed by the [Maryland State Library](https://www.marylandlibraries.org/Pages/Maryland%20Libraries%20Home.aspx). Before Covid, my child and I spent the majority of our time in Baltimore's Enoch Pratt libraries. They are an invaluable resource to everyone-- especially young families. To keep this resource available for generations to come, support your local library.

The ASCII letters and numbers were done by me. ASCII animal art came from [The ASCII Art Archive](https://www.asciiart.eu/).
